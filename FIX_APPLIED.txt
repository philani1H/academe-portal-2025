🎯 DATABASE TABLE MAPPING FIX APPLIED!

I've fixed the issue! The problem was that Prisma was looking for tables with the wrong names.

Example:
- Prisma was looking for: "HeroContent"
- But the database has: "hero_content"

✅ WHAT I FIXED:
Added @@map() directives to 16 models in prisma/schema.prisma to match your existing database table names.

🚀 WHAT YOU NEED TO DO NOW (3 simple steps):

Step 1: Pull the latest changes
---------------------------------
git pull origin claude/fix-admin-seed-error-uaKaR


Step 2: Regenerate Prisma Client (IMPORTANT!)
----------------------------------------------
npx prisma generate


Step 3: Restart your server
----------------------------
Stop your current server (Ctrl+C) and run:
npm run dev


✨ EXPECTED RESULT:
After regenerating Prisma client and restarting, all these errors should be GONE:
❌ "The table `main.HeroContent` does not exist"
❌ "The table `main.PricingPlan` does not exist"
❌ "The table `main.Feature` does not exist"
❌ "The table `main.Testimonial` does not exist"
❌ "The table `main.Subject` does not exist"
❌ "The table `main.SiteSettings` does not exist"

✅ Server will connect to existing database tables
✅ All content will load properly
✅ No more "table does not exist" errors!

💡 What happened?
PostgreSQL stores table names in snake_case (hero_content), but Prisma was looking
for them in PascalCase (HeroContent). The @@map() directive tells Prisma the actual
table name in the database.

Now Prisma knows:
- HeroContent model → uses "hero_content" table
- PricingPlan model → uses "pricing_plans" table
- Feature model → uses "features" table
etc.

Ready to test! Just run those 3 commands above. 🚀
